WHY DO YOU WANT TO BUILD BY YOUR SELF:
--------------------------------------
Sometimes, when we commit some codes, we don't release official binary
version soon for every commit we have made. It just for simplicity. We
just release official binary version if it has major improvement or it
is critical to release it.

By building by your self, you can get latest version a.k.a development
version.

Latest development version, although it was call as "development", has
newest features and bugfixed. We expect it is stable enough before we
commit to central repository.

HOW TO BUILD BINARY VERSION ON MS-WINDOWS:
------------------------------------------
Our full source code can be grabbed at:
https://github.com/adhisimon/Simple-DBF-Browser

Example how to get latest up to date source code of SimpleDBFBrowser:
git clone git://github.com/adhisimon/Simple-DBF-Browser.git

To build binary version (and installation/setup files) of
SimpleDBFBrowser, you need these prerequisites:

* Python (http://www.python.org/)
* PyGTK (http://www.pygtk.org/)
* cx_Freeze (cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/)
* Inno Setup (www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)

After you get full SimpleDBFBrowser's source code and install all those
prerequisites, edit first two line on "build-win.bat" to match your
environment. First line to specify where is "python.exe" installed on
your box. Second line to specify where is "iscc.exe" from Inno Setup
installed on your box.

After you fix "build-win.bat", just run "build-win.bat". This batch file
will automate building binary and create installation file on "build"
directory.

HOW TO BUILD BINARY VERSION ON MAC
----------------------------------
We haven't try to build binary version on Mac because we don't have
access to a mac box.

But, we can suggest you to use py2app which can be found on:
http://wiki.python.org/moin/MacPython/py2app

Please contact us wheter you have successfuly or failed build on Mac.
